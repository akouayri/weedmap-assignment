# Case Study Exercise: Salesforce Developer

As a Salesforce Developer, you will be at the center of designing and sustaining our current CRM and
Salesforce solutions. As we continue to grow with new revenue streams, regulations and business needs,
we need a hands-on developer with an admin background and a creative mind that can play a major role
in providing streamlined solutions and long -term maintenance of our system.

# Question 1:

Objective: You must create a round robin for lead conversion in Salesforce. After a lead is converted, we
want to be able to round robin accounts based on user capacity and account billing state.
Context: If you have three people in the round robin and one has five accounts, but the other two have
two accounts each, then the automation would evenly assign the six new accounts out between the two
who have two before the person who has five gets another account.

# Question 2:

You have a non-salesforce CRM you need to integrate with Salesforce. In the external CRM, accounts
and &quot;deals&quot; are on the same table, but products are on a child table. How do you build an API to split the
external CRM tables into Accounts, Opportunities and Products in Salesforce?
